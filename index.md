## Sanskrit Chants used by Sadhguru's Isha Yoga Foundation

This website provides the sanskrit chants that are used in various _pujas_ by _Isha_. We want to present the chants in original sanskrit. Sanskrit has no script of it's own. So we will be presenting the chants in all Indian scripts. Devanagari and Telugu being prioritized. Unfortunately Tamil does not support a lot of Sanskrit letters. So for now you might have to read it in the Roman alphabet via the lossless _IAST_ format for rendering sanskrit.
